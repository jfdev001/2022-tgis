    "# Python Doesn't Byte: by Jared Frazier and Marie McCord\n",
    "## What is Python?\n",
    "Python is a high-level, general purpose programming language. This is just\n",
    "fancy talk for \"Python is a *tool* that you can use to tell a computer how\n",
    "to perform a task. \"High level\" just means that you don't have to learn the \n",
    "language of the machine, which is creatively called *machine language*, in \n",
    "order to tell a computer how to do cool things.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Learn Python?\n",
    "You can make cool stuff like websites, games, chatbots, and more with it. \n",
    "In fact organizations like Netflix, Google, \n",
    "NASA, use Python extensively. Here are some examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Netflix: `Open Connect` -- Uses Python to deliver content to \n",
    "its viewers. When you watch a movie on Netflix, now you know the way that movie\n",
    "is delivered to you with Python.\n",
    "2. Google: `YouTube Recommendations ` -- Uses Python to make video\n",
    "recommendations to different users. So if you watch a video on the mysteries\n",
    "of black holes in outer space, and then you get recommended another video\n",
    "that is similar to that, know that it is Python at work!\n",
    "3. NASA: `Astrobee: free-flying robots` -- Uses Python to control a robot\n",
    "on the international Space Station (ISS). While you may not be on the ISS right \n",
    "now, maybe one day you will be and you can interact with these useful, cube-shaped\n",
    "robots!\n",
    "\n",
    "What you'll find is that these examples use Python in addition to other languages\n",
    "like C, C++, JavaScript, etc., but you have to start somewhere before you can\n",
    "learn more languages, so Python is where we will begin!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Syntax\n",
    "**Syntax:** The rules that define the combination of symbols that are considered\n",
    "valid statements or expressions in that language. English, Spanish, Cantonese... \n",
    "these are all natural languages, but you know for example in English that the \n",
    "sentence `He threw the ball.` is valid but `The ball threw he.` is not valid.\n",
    "Similarly, programming languages have valid sentences, which are called *statements*,\n",
    "and each programming language has different syntax. Fortunately, once you learn\n",
    "one programming language, the syntax of the other languages is not as varied as\n",
    "in natural languages. You could learn Python over the next few months, then if you\n",
    "were to look at another language, it would not be as difficult to learn.\n",
