What would be the best way to teach students about inputs, outputs, and control
structures? A text based adventure. Could be used to teach object oriented 
or functional concepts. For example, a person might define a monster class
and a player class, then instantiate those classes during the text based game and manipulate them with their own story logic.

```
class Player:
	def __init__(self, name):
		pass

	def attack(self, ):
		"""Strength based solution."""
		pass

	def charm(self, ):
		"""Charisma based solution."""
		pass

	def solve(self, ):
		"""Intelligence based solution"""
		pass

class Monster:
	def __init__(self, name):
		pass

	def attack(self,):
		pass

def main():
	while not player_defeated and not end_game:
		# get inputs 
		pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
	main()
```
