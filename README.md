Description for TGIS Program:

_Fundamental programming language concepts such as data types and loops will be introduced using the Python programming language. After this brief introduction, students will get right to a project and will design and then code their own unique text-based adventure game! Learn to code and let your creativity run wild in this Python programming language crash course!_

Note for teaching: Make sure that output cells have been cleared for any tutorial ipynbs.

# Using the Browser

In the event that you do not have a working development environment setup on your computer (i.e., a local installation of Python), you can emulate this by using resources that are freely available online. While [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/scratchpad/notebookbb762fa10d/edit) are both popular, you would have to sign in to gain access to most of their useful features.
