# Using the Browser

In the event that you do not have a working development environment setup on your computer (i.e., a local installation of Python), you can emulate this by using resources that are freely available online. While [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/scratchpad/notebookbb762fa10d/edit) are both popular, you would have to sign in to gain access to most of their useful features.

An alternative is to use [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/) and simply follow these steps to use a an interactive ipython notebook (`.ipynb`) in your browser:

1. Navigate to [https://cocalc.com/](https://cocalc.com/)
2. Click _Try CoCalc Now_
3. Click _Use CoCalc Anonymously_
4. Scroll to the bottom of the next page and click
   _View Your CoCalc Projects..._
5. Name your project and click _Create Project_
6. Click _Start Project_
7. Wait... this might take ~30 seconds to 1 minute
8. Click _Create or Upload Files..._
9. Click _Jupyter Notebook_
10. Click _Python 3 (system-wide)_ under _Suggested Kernels_
11. Now you have an `.ipynb`! You can run cells (execute code)
    in the notebook by using `SHIFT + ENTER` on your keyboard!
12. Test your notebook by typing `print('Hello, world!')` and then
    clicking `SHIFT + ENTER` on your keyboard OR clicking the _Run_ button
    in the notebook.
